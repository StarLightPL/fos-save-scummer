From Other Suns simple save scummer .bat

# description
From Other Suns is a roguelike VR Faster Than Light clone. Unfortunately game was released unfinished and abandoned, hence is missing essential balance passes. Due to that there's a serious difficulty spike around 50% progress into the game and if you're unlucky, you can die pretty easily. I made a very simple save scummer which will allow you to backup your save 

# "installation"

1. Backup your save
2. Put the scum_saves.bat inside your %appdata% directory: `%AppData%\..\Local\FoS\Saved`
3. Run the .bat file
4. Choose "Switch saves to multiplayer" - this will create directories and backup your current saves as singleplayer saves
5. Choose "Switch saves to singleplayer" - as above, for multiplayer

You're ready to save scum :-)

# usage
Game saves your items upon game exit, players death, hyperspace jump or mission end. You should put all items on the rack or throw it on the floor before saving. It's best to drop them after a successful mission and before the jump. That way you can ensure that your weapons will actually be saved. If you're playing multiplayer, then your teammates absolutely must drop their gear, because other players gear seems not to be saved with your save.

So, to recap:
1. After a successful mission, drop all gear on the racks or on the floor (everyone).
2. Jump
3. Save game using the scummer option 1.

Optionally instead of jumping, you can exit the session, but that way it's more cumbersome.
